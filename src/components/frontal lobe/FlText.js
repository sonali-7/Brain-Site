    <h1>THE FRONTAL LOBE</h1>
         <p>
          The frontal lobe is the largest of the four major lobes of the brain. 	The frontal lobe is important for voluntary movement, expressive language and for managing higher level executive functions. Functioning fo this lobe is critical to self-identity and our cognitive abilties.
          The frontal lobe covers many cortical areas. The premotor cortex, the primary motor cortex, and the prefrontal cortex. Aside from these cortical areas, the frontal lobe contains many more small regions. 
          </p>
         <h2>Prefrontal Cortex</h2>
         <p >This brain region has been implicated in executive functions, such as planning, decision making, short-term memory, personality expression, moderating social behavior and controlling certain aspects of speech and language. Since 2010, neuroscience has shown that the prefrontal cortex in the human brain does not reach its cognitive peak until age 25 in most people, extending adolescence past puberty. </p>
         <h3>Clinincal Relevance</h3>
         <p>
         The prefrontal cortex is well-known for its involvement in emotion, mood, and sentience. Reduced prefrontal cortex size & activity is associated with those diagnosed with mental disorders, those incarcerated, those affected by lead poisoning, and much more. The Prefrontal Cortex has also been a hot topic in the field of neuroscientific depression study.  

         </p>
         
         <h2>Motor Cortex</h2>
         <p>
         Neurons in the premotor cortex strongly influence behavior in the primary motor cortex. They seem to be highly involved in the selection of which movements one carries out. 
The medial premotor cortex is similar in function. However, it more concerned with internal cues rather than external cues to move.
